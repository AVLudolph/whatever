            <h3>Audience: 25-30 6th graders for beginning drama class. Mix of boys and girls. </h3>

<h3>Instructional Objectives: </h3> <p>Students will be able to analyze the incorporation of story in online games. Students will create a story based game using a myth as the inspiration. Students will create and perform a myth based performance to go hand in hand with their game. </p>

<h3>Context:</h3><p>Prior to discussing story in games, students will have completed a unit on ancient greek theatre. Students will have read a short play about the role of myths in ancient Greek theatre. They will have also completed a unit on playwriting and have had experience writing and performing short plays for their classmates.</p>  

<h3>Timeline:</h3> <p> The instructional and practical  portion of this unit will take ten days (2 weeks) to complete in 45 minute segments.</p> 

<h3>Units: </h3>
<p>Become acquainted with Gamestar Mechanics. What role does the story play in your experience with  the games? (2 classes)
Find a myth and write a script using the myth as the inspiration (3 classes)
    Once script writing is completed, students will create a game on gamestar to share.</p>
<p>Rehearse and prepare performance. Once students are ready, their teacher will film their performance. (3 classes)</p>
<p>All groups will be assigned to work with one or two other groups. Within these arrangements they will 2-3 groups will be playing and assessing the work of their peers.</p>
<p>Feedback and review. What they did well and how they could improve? Class discussion: What are other ways we can tell stories?</p>


<h2>
Part 1: 
</h2>
<h3>
Instructor: </h3>
<ol>
<li>
The instructor will begin by checking out chromebooks(or laptops) to students. Login directions to Gamestar Mechanics for students will be posted on the board. </li>
<li>
Once all students are logged on and have started their exploration of the site, the teacher will be monitoring, answering questions, and facilitating their exploration experience. </li>
<li>
 At the end of the second day, the instructor will facilitate a discussion on storytelling in games.
</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>
                Questions:</h3><p>(to be posted on the board individually [with powerpoint] as they are being discussed )</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>How did the story affect your experience with the mini games and challenges?</li>
                <li>What are some other games you play that are driven by the story?</li>
                <li>How is this related to what we’ve been learning about storytelling in theatre?</li>
                <li>Who are the characters? (who is the protagonist/ antagonist?)</li>
                <li>What are the settings?</li>
                <li>What is the conflict? </li>
                <li>Do you think you could design a game around a story?</li>
                <li>What would you need to begin that process?</li>

<h3>Students: </h3>
<ol>
    <li>Students will log into Gamestar Mechanics.</li>
<li>Students will complete the training by following the story provided. As they complete the game they are learning about how to create their own games. This knowledge will help them to complete the final product. If students have questions they will first ask one of their peers for help. If they are still confused they will ask the teacher for further instruction.</li>
                </ol>
<p>
What technologies are being used and in what ways? Many of the students in a 6th grade drama class may have never been to a live play, while most will have had experiences with video games. To connect what they are learning to real life scenarios, students will be looking at the storytelling used in Gamestar Mechanics. Students will reflect on how this form of story telling connects to theatre and how it can engage an audience. Students will be using computers to practice creating games in preparation to tell their own stories.</p>

<h3>
Explanation of how this is transformative: </h3>
<p>
The use of this technology helps bridge traditional theatre and performance with modern game based storytelling. Students will apply what they have learned about creating a scripted performance with online gaming. Students who may not normally see the personal relevance of storytelling in their lives may find a new connection through their interest in online gaming. 
As in all learning, reflection and feedback is vital to improvement. As students engage in  each other’s work they have the chance to reflect on what works and what doesn't. They may provide needed feedback in helping others to improve while gaining insight into their own work. 
This constructionist approach to learning allows students to learn and create in an authentic way. Rather than having the teacher be the expert in the room, they will be the facilitator guiding students in creating their own unique final product. As students are able to help each other they are validated as teachers and leaders in their own right, which will empower them in their own creative discovery. </p>
