            <p> <img src="images/profilepic.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="profilepic"></p>
            <p>Ashley Ludolph has taught grades K-12 across the united states. She has found a great love of working with middle school students. Ashley has been involved in theatre since she started her first drama class in the 6th grade. After seeing a change in culture among her students, with more and more students becoming tech centerened, she decided to look for a way to make theatre more relivant to them. After seeing how technology has transformed Broadway, she decided that engaging more technology in her classroom was exactly waht her students would need. She hopes that this website will open that discussion among fellow Theatre teachers. </p>
